# DGBA: A Game Boy Advance emulator written in Odin

My thought is that I will implement this emulator according to the docs [here](https://goiabada.github.io/docs/)

## Goals
 - [Parallel by default](https://www.rfleury.com/p/multi-core-by-default)
 - Rendering exclusively with Vulkan compute shaders
 - No OS abstraction (i.e. SDL)
